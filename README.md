# Mysterious-Corpse-TTS-STT-Asterisk-Version
Mysterious Corpse, for voice, via Asterisk and VOIP.  I used Google Speech-to-text and Text-to-speech to elicit answers from callers and to speak the resulting mystery sentence-mashups back to them.  

A couple of earlier test files here, but finals as well. 
Experimenting with voice, VOIP and Ruby.
